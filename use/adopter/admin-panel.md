## Overview


[UCI Admin](https://github.com/samagra-comms/uci-admin) is a web client powered by [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs) ,[ChatUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/samagra-chatui) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and using [UCI](https://github.com/samagra-comms) as backend.
It demonstrates how we can manage the conversation bot.

In order to start any conversation, we must first create a bot. These bots are powered by ODK. 
The following steps are required to create a bot:-

  * Provide the segment Id (Unified Communication Interface | Messages)  

  * Provide the bot's Start and End Date.

Once an ODK form is uploaded, the same form cannot be used again with the same form version.
{% endhint %}
 

#### Submit the form.
Once the form and media are successfully uploaded, click on the add button to submit the conversation logic.
